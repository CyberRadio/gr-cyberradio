	 * \brief Base class for a thread object, based on Boost Threads.
	 *
	 * Basic procedure for using this class:
	 * \li Derive a threading class from Thread.
	 * \li Override the run() method to provide the thread's processing
	 *     loop.
	 * \li Call the sleep() method on occasion within the run()
	 *     method implementation to check for user interrupts.
	 * \li Override onInterrupt() to perform processing that must
	 *     be done when the thread is interrupted (stopped by the
	 *     user).
	 * \li Override onException() to perform processing that must
	 *     be done when an unhandled exception occurs within the
	 *     run() method.
	 * \li Call the start() method from a higher-level thread or
	 *     execution loop to begin thread processing.
	 * \li Call the interrupt() method from a higher-level thread
	 *     or execution loop to interrupt (stop) thread processing.
	 *
	 * \note Because this threading class is based on Boost Threads,
	 *    users should use its sleep() method to do any waiting,
	 *    because it checks for user interrupts within the Boost
	 *    threading layer.
