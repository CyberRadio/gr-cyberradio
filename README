INTRODUCTION
------------
This document describes the components of the CRS Driver
and control software, and how to build them.


DEBIAN PACKAGES
---------------
The CRS Driver and control software is deployed on target
systems via Debian packages.  

The GNU Radio control software can be deployed in two different ways:
* Package gr-cyberradio includes all supported components of the 
  control software.  To generate the Debian packages for this method,
  use these commands:
  ./makedeb cyberradiodriver
  ./makedeb libcyberradio
  ./makedeb gr-cyberradio
  Note that this last command requires installing the libcyberradio
  package generated by the previous command.
* Packages gr-cyberradio-* implement a more modular packaging and 
  deployment system, thus allowing CRS to distribute only the packages
  that a particular installation and/or customer require.  To generate 
  the Debian packages for this method, use this command:
  ./make_all_debs 
Note that these two deployment methods are intended to be mutually exclusive.

Packages gr-cyberradio and gr-cyberradio-* require the following software
in order to build:
* Ubuntu packages: devscripts, doxygen, cmake, libcppunit-dev, swig
* Python
* Boost libraries
* GNU Radio software
Note that these packages in turn may have their own dependencies.

The following table lists the packages that can be distributed and what 
they do.
